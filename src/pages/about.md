        content: >
          As a designer, I like to solve problems and daily challenges, either
          conceptual or technicals. I have an analytical, human, and strategic
          approach. For me context, function, and visual appealing are
          essential.


          “When it comes to my work, I like to define myself as a Problem
          solver. I use design as a tool for research, identify needs and
          opportunities. Therefore to innovate, communicate, and make a better
          world”.

          I am serious, focused, direct, and empathetic. But also friendly, with
          good humor, a big smile, and enthusiasm.


          I am looking to use my 4 years of experience in Design and Advertising
          to create remindful brand stories. Collaborate daily with creatives,
          and learn from challenges and clients daily.


          Looking forward to challenges in a permanent or freelance role.

        content: >
          I recharge my creative mind, body, and soul by learning new things and
          exercising. I am currently learning: how to sing, tap dancing, sewing,
          and tuning my skills in animation.


          When I am outdoors, I like exploring London with my bike and visiting
          art galleries.
